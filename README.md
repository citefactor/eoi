# eoi - electronic object identifier

**What is a persistent URL? What is an EOI?**
A persistent URL is one that never changes. Persistent URLs are designed so that your bookmarks and links don't break when a website gets updated.
On the ICPSR website, our study descriptions now have persistent URLs. If you want to bookmark a study page or link to it from your website, you should bookmark/link the persistent URL. In most browsers, you can do this by right-clicking on the link. In the menu that appears, there will be an option to add it to your bookmarks.

**EOIs**
EOI stands for Electronic Object Identifier (see The EOI System). An EOI is a unique persistent identifier for a published digital object, such as an article or a study. An EOI also links to an article or study. Here is an example of a citation with an EOI:

Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Date of publication). Title of article. Title of Journal, volume number, page range. https://eoi.citefactor.org/10.2345/jcp.6438
The EOI in this example is 10.2345/jcp.6438 and it links to the URL:
https://eoi.citefactor.org/10.2345/jcp.6438

EOIs are concise and easy to include in a citation. If you publish an article and you include the EOI in the data citation as one of your references, you make it easy for other researchers to get back to the original data.

EOIs are also part of an integrated network of linkages between articles and datasets that is maintained by publishers and archives through registration agencies. The inclusion of EOIs in citations makes it much easier for us to see how a report or dataset generates other research, which in turn assists researchers in demonstrating the value and scientific impact of their work.

**How do I get a EOI for my survey?**
EOIs are created/registered by publishing organizations, not by individuals. If you deposit your data with registered publisher, theyâ€™ll assign an EOI for your study.

**How do I get a EOI for my report or article?**
The journal/publisher of the article should assign the EOI. If your publisher isn't registering EOIs, you should encourage them to do so. The Citefactor website has useful information on how to get started.

**How do I use EOIs?**
Include them in your footnotes and references. Just copy and paste the citation, as you normally would, along with the EOI. By properly citing the data and including the EOI, you're giving proper credit to the investigators who conducted the research and giving the scholarly community a clearer picture of the impact of the research.
